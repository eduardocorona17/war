# Game Title: "War!"
Info: In this version of war, two players draw a card simultaneously. The player with the higher card value keeps both theirs and the other players cards accruing one point for each win. In the case of a tie, both players keep their own card and their scores stay the same. Winner who reaches 10 points first wins. 

Technology used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Getting Started: To start the game, simply click the "Draw Card" button.

Next Steps: In the future I would like to updayte the CSS and make it look like a more modern game and not something from 2001.
